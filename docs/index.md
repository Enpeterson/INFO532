Authors: Alex Edwards \& Emily Peterson
Fall 2023


<img src="fig/plot1.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />


This *Advanced GIS* Fall 2023 class is a project-based exploration of advanced topics in GIS and geospatial technology, with a focus on spatial modeling, advanced spatial analysis and geoprocessing, spatial data manipulation, and geocomputation. For information on course expectations, assignments, grading, and schedule, please review the course syllabus listed on Canvas. We will use this e-book for lectures, and in-class activities. All course content will be housed in this book for your reference. 


Advanced GIS analysis methods covered in this course include: (1) spatial data wrangling, (2) point data analysis, (3) area data analysis, (4) raster data, (5) spatial interpolation, (6) spatial autocorrelation. 

There are two sections to this class (in-person and asynchronous). Synchronous sessions meets Mondays and Wednesdays 10:00-11:50 am in GCR P45. The in-person session classes are broken down into 2 components. The first half of the class will be lecture, and the second half of the class will be used as "lab-time" for you to work on projects. Students enrolled in the asynchronous are welcome to join the in-person class when they can if extra help is needed.

  - Brunsdon, C. (2018). An introduction to r for spatial analysis and mapping (2nd edition). SAGE Publications. 
  - Comber and Brunson (2021) Geographical Data Science and Spatial Data Analysis:  An Introduction in R. Sage. London.




### Grading {-}

+ 4 labs: 40\% (one lab per week)
+ 1 Case Study report (and presentation for in-person class): 50\%
+ Participation in class activities, discussion boards, etc. (required): 10\%

### Labs {-}

+ Post HW on Canvass
+ Labs are due Wednesday 10 AM. 
+ *Important* Start your filename with your NAME! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
+ This is a project-based class. You will br assigned a case-study of interest, which contains both point and area data. Each lab will consist of taking the learned topics discussed in each module and applying it to your project application. We will define the exact output to be submitted for each lab. 

### How do I get help? {-}
 + Direct emails can get lost so send messages through Canvas.
 + Post questions on discussion board for labs. Others may have the same question.
 + If you have a similar question to one posted, please tag that post.

### Diversity and Inclusion Statement {-}

At its core, this course embraces a multiplicity of voices and perspectives. We respect people from all backgrounds and recognize the differences among ourselves, including racial and ethnic identities, religious practices, and gender expressions. Please let me know what name you like to be called and your gender pronouns. 

We all come from different backgrounds and interests. In this course, it is essential to be inclusive of all who have come to learn. We all can learn from one another, and this is a safe space to share our views and educate one another on accepting and inclusive language. 

Please use NAMECOACH on Canvas to help learn how to say your name, and please bare with me if I do not get it easily. I have a terrible memory. 



### Using this notebook {-}

This notebook contains the lectures for the class. All lectures will be recorded and uploaded to Canvas for each module. At the end of each module a lab assignment is included.
